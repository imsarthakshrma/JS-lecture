## Let's Dive Deep into These Topics:

### 1. Functions (Review)

**Anonymous Functions:**

An anonymous function is simply a function that doesn't have a name. These are often used as arguments to other functions or for short-lived tasks where naming them isn't necessary. They can be defined in two ways:

```javascript
let greet = function() {
  console.log("Hello!");
};
greet(); // Output: Hello!
```

Here, `greet` is a variable holding an anonymous function. Though it has no name, it behaves like any other function.

Anonymous functions are typically used with array methods or event handlers.

**Example:**

```javascript
setTimeout(function() {
  console.log("This runs after 2 seconds!");
}, 2000);
```

**Arrow Functions (ES6):**

Arrow functions provide a concise way to write functions. They don't require the `function` keyword and have a different way of handling the `this` keyword (important in object-oriented programming, which we'll get to later).

**Syntax:**

```javascript
const greet = () => {
  console.log("Hello, Arrow Function!");
};
greet(); // Output: Hello, Arrow Function!
```

Arrow functions are especially useful when you want to simplify functions into a single line of code.

**Example (One-liner):**

```javascript
const add = (a, b) => a + b;
console.log(add(2, 3)); // Output: 5
```

Notice there's no need for curly braces or a return keyword when you have a single line returning a value.

### 2. Array Methods: `forEach()`, `map()`, `filter()`

**`forEach()`:**

This method allows you to loop through an array and execute a function on each element. It doesn't return a new array; it simply iterates over the existing array.

**Syntax:**

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
numbers.forEach(function(num) {
  console.log(num);
});
```

**Explanation:**

- The `forEach()` method takes a function (called a callback) as an argument.
- It will execute this function for every element in the array.

**Deeper Dive:**

- `forEach()` is mainly used when you don't need to modify the array but simply want to perform some action, like printing elements or updating the DOM.

**`map()`:**

The `map()` method is used to transform an array. It returns a new array where each element has been modified by the provided function.

**Syntax:**

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const doubled = numbers.map(function(num) {
  return num * 2;
});
console.log(doubled); // Output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```

**Deeper Dive:**

- Notice that `map()` doesn't change the original arrayâ€”it creates a new one. This is important for immutability (keeping data unchanged), which is useful in React and other modern frameworks.

**`filter()`:**

The `filter()` method returns a new array containing only elements that pass a test (specified by a function).

**Syntax:**

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const evens = numbers.filter(function(num) {
  return num % 2 === 0;
});
console.log(evens); // Output: [2, 4]
```

**Deeper Dive:**

- `filter()` is often used when you want to reduce an array based on a condition. It's great for removing unwanted values or selecting specific ones.


### 3. Loops (Review and Expansion)

**`for...of` Loop**

Introduced in ES6, the `for...of` loop allows you to iterate over arrays or other iterable objects. It's simpler and often more readable than traditional `for` loops when working with arrays and strings. The `for...of` loop focuses on the **values** of the elements rather than their indices.

**Syntax:**

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
for (let num of numbers) {
  console.log(num); // Output: 1, 2, 3
}
```

**Deeper Dive:**

- Prefer `for...of` loops for iterating over arrays and strings as it improves readability.
- It's not suitable for objects (unless the object is specifically designed to be iterable).

### 4. Higher-Order Functions

**What are Higher-Order Functions?**

A higher-order function is a function that:

* Takes another function as an argument (**function as parameter**).
* Returns a function as its result (**function as return value**).

This is an important concept in functional programming and is widely used with array methods like `map()`, `filter()`, and `forEach()`.

**Example:**

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  console.log("Hello " + name);
}

function callGreet(func) {
  func("Alice");
}

callGreet(greet); // Output: Hello Alice
```

Here, `callGreet()` takes another function `greet` as its argument and executes it. This demonstrates the essence of higher-order functions.

**Example with `map()`:**

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
const squares = numbers.map(function(num) {
  return num * num;
});
console.log(squares); // Output: [1, 4, 9]
```

In this case, `map()` is a higher-order function because it takes a function as an argument (the anonymous function that squares each number).

### Homework

**Easy:**

**Task:** Write a function that takes an array of numbers and prints each number multiplied by 2 using `forEach()`.

**Test:** Try this with an array of `[1, 2, 3, 4]`.

```javascript
function printDoubled(numbers) {
  numbers.forEach(function(number) {
    console.log(number * 2);
  });
}

const myNumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];
printDoubled(myNumbers);
```

**Medium:**

**Task:** Write a function that takes an array of numbers and returns a new array where each number is doubled using `map()`.

**Test:** Use `[2, 4, 6]` and expect `[4, 8, 12]`.

```javascript
function doubleNumbers(numbers) {
  return numbers.map(function(number) {
    return number * 2;
  });
}

const myNumbers = [2, 4, 6];
const doubledNumbers = doubleNumbers(myNumbers);
console.log(doubledNumbers); // Output: [4, 8, 12]
```

**Hard:**

**Task:** Write a function `filterEvens` that takes an array of numbers and returns only the even numbers using `filter()`.

**Test:** Use `[1, 2, 3, 4]` and expect `[2, 4]`.

```javascript
function filterEvens(numbers) {
  return numbers.filter(function(number) {
    return number % 2 === 0;
  });
}

const myNumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];
const evenNumbers = filterEvens(myNumbers);
console.log(evenNumbers); // Output: [2, 4]
```
